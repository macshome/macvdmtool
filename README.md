# Apple Silicon to Apple Silicon VDM tool

This tool lets you get a serial console on an Apple Silicon device and reboot it remotely, using only another Apple Silicon device running macOS and a standard Type C cable.

Thanks to t8012.dev and mrarm for assistance with the VDM and Ace2 host interface commands.

## Building

Install the XCode commandline tools and type `make`.

## Usage

Connect the two devices via their DFU ports. That's the rear port on MacBooks and the port nearest to the power plug on Mac Minis.

You need to use a *USB 3.0 compatible* (SuperSpeed) Type C cable. USB 2.0-only cables, including most cables meant for charging, will not work, as they do not have the required pins. Thunderbolt cables work too.

Run it as root (`sudo ./macvdmtool`).

```
Usage: ./macvdmtool <command>
Commands:
  serial - enter serial mode on both ends
  reboot - reboot the target
  reboot serial - reboot the target and enter serial mode
  dfu - put the target into DFU mode
  nop - do nothing
```

Use `/dev/cu.debug_console` on the local machine as your serial device. To use it with m1n1, `export M1N1DEVICE=/dev/cu.debug-console`.

For typical development, the command you want to use is `macvdmtool reboot serial`. This will reboot the target, and immediately put it back into serial mode, with the right timing to make it work.
